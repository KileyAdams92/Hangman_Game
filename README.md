Great Lakes Shipwrecks Style Hangman

This project is designed to function as a simple hangman style game with three word options for guessing. The user guesses a single letter at a time, decreasing the number of attempts remaining (ranging from 20-0). The game displays letters as they are chosen on the screen, and alerts players when an incorrect key is pressed. Once a user has guessed the entire word, a picture of the corresponding ship shows up on the left column, the user can then press the reset button to reset the word to a new word. The number of wins goes up by 1 with each correct full word guessed. 

Motivation

This project was completed in the early stages of learning web development at The University of Kansas. The purpose of this project was to learn and develop basic skills with JavaScript.

The user can follow the link provided(https://kileyadams92.github.io/Hangman_Game/) The user is instructed to press any key to begin.

If the user guesses the word(s) correctly, a related image appears and the user is awarded one point – the user must press reset to restart the game. When pressing reset, the accumulated points remain. If the user does not guess the correct letters, they are informed the game is over.
