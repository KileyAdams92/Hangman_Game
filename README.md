# Hangman_Game

What the project does?

This project is designed to function as a simple hangman style game with three word options for guessing. The user guesses a single letter at a time, decreasing the number of attempts remaining (ranging from 20-0). The game displays letters as they are chosen on the screen, and alerts players when an incorrect key is pressed. Once a user has guessed the entire word, a picture of the corresponding ship shows up on the left column, the user can then press the reset button to reset the word to a new word. The number of wins goes up by 1 with each correct full word guessed.
